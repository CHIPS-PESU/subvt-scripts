Liberate Examples README
========================

This directory contains 5 Tcl scripts to run Liberate. 

1.  This example creates a new library from just the Spice subckts and Spice models.

> liberate char.tcl |& tee char.log


2.  Create a template from the previously created library

> liberate create_template.tcl |& tee create_library.log


3.  This example creates a new library using the template created from the existing i
library in step 2 above plus Spice subckts and Spice models.

> liberate rechar.tcl |& tee rechar.log


4.  This example compares two libraries, example_ccs.lib and 
example_rechar_ccs.lib. Liberate generates a comparison report (with 
reltol and abstol set to 0) and a lcplot input file ./GUI/example.gui

> liberate compare_libs.tcl |& tee compare_libs.log

5.  This example will use the ALAPI (ALtos API) commands to generate a report
from a library that was read in.  This example reads an existing library 
database (.ldb) and gives a simple example for each of the basic ALtos API (ALAPI) 
routines.  It generates a report and provides an example of how to write
customized reports.

> liberate alapi.tcl |& tee alapi.log
