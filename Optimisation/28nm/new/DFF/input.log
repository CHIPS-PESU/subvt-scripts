Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity:

If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

Notice from spectre during transient analysis `trans-000_trans', during task `MDLControl'.
    Trapezoidal ringing is detected during tran analysis.
        Please use method=trap for better results and performance.


Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(I19.PM15:int_d) = 377.2 mV
I: I(V0:p) = 11.63 uA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

    Trapezoidal ringing is detected during tran analysis.

Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(I19.PM15:int_d) = 377.2 mV
I: I(V0:p) = 11.63 uA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(I19.PM15:int_d) = 377.2 mV
I: I(V0:p) = 11.63 uA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.
