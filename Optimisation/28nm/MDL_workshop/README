May-2006:
This is the workshop for SpectreMDL. The steps required to work 
through the workshop are listed and described in:

"SpectreMDL Workshop Tutorial"

For the detail description on SpectreMDL product, refer to  
the Cadence publication "SpectreMDL User Guide and Reference".


Getting Started 
---------------

The files for the workshop are in a tarred, compressed file, called 
MDL_workshop.tar.Z, located in the same directory that holds this 
README file. A tutorial called "SpectreMDL Workshop Tutorial" to 
work through the workshop is located in the same directory as well.

To prepare for the workshop:

1. Copy MDL_worshop.tar.Z to the directory where you want to install 
   the workshop files.

2. Move to the directory that you copied the file into and uncompress and 
   untar the file. For example, you might use the command:

   zcat MDL_workshop.tar.Z | tar -xvf -

3. Move down into the directory MDL_workshop. That directory contains 
   five sub-directories: mdl_meas, dflip, optimize, montecarlo and advance.

4. Check your setup by running the command below

   % which spectremdl

   If the operating system does not return the location of the executable 
   file, check your installation.

5. Run the command below

   % printenv SPECTRE_DEFAULTS

   and ensure that the simulator is not set to write wsfbin, nutbin, or 
   any of the ASCII formats. To use SpectreMDL, the simulator must be 
   using the psfbin format.

6. Follow the instructions in the "SpectreMDL Workshop Tutorial" to continue.
